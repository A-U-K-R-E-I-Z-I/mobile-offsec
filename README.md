## Why?

A lot of things in the mobile application penetration testing - especially on generic stuff, like install certificates on specifics API levels or extract JNI calls - can be easily automated, so I created this shitty to help you and me to stop doing manual kinds of stuff every time on a lab.

This repository is focused on Android and iOS, but not only the applications itself, but also aim to payment terminals penetration testing or any kind of "mobile" device that can be pwned.
